# ESLint Demo

Welcome to the ESLint Demo repository! This simple application is designed to help you understand how ESLint rules work by providing a clear demonstration of rules configured in the `.eslintrc` file. You can clone this repository to explore and experiment with different ESLint rules and see how they impact your code.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the ESLint Demo:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mahval/es-lint-demo.git
```

2. Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Then, install the project dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

3. Explore ESLint Rules:

Open the `.eslintrc` file in the root directory of the project. Here, you will find various ESLint rules configured for this project. You can modify these rules or add new ones to see how ESLint enforces them in your code.

4. Run ESLint:

You can run ESLint to check your code against the configured rules by using the following command:

```
$ npm run lint
```

ESLint will analyze your code and display any errors or warnings based on the rules defined in the `.eslintrc` file.

5. Modify Code:

Feel free to experiment with the code in the project. You can intentionally introduce code that violates ESLint rules to see how ESLint identifies and reports issues.

You can also experiment with this setting in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true
```

6. Customize ESLint Configuration:

If you want to customize ESLint rules for this project, you can do so by editing the `.eslintrc` file. Add, remove, or modify rules to fit your coding standards and preferences.
